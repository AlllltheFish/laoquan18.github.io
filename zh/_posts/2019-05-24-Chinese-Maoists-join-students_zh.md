The students have been campaigning for workers of stock market-listed Jasic Technology, who are fighting for union rights, through street rallies, demonstrations, fundraising and open letters.
The Shenzhen, Guangdong province, company is a manufacturer of electronic welding machines and robotic arms. Efforts to start a union resulted in a crackdown by factory management and city authorities last month, according to workers.
Seven Jasic worker representatives have been sacked, beaten and detained and 29 of their supporters arrested. They include family members, colleagues and a student.
As of Tuesday night, 14 people – including a nursing mother, Zhang Zeying – were still in detention for allegedly picking quarrels and disrupting order.
