1st August 2019

On January 8th, the police stormed an urban village residence and detained “iLabour” website editor Yang Zhengjun.Three months later, on March 20th, police detained another two editors —Wei Zhili and KeChengbing. The three activists collaborate to produce “iLabour”, an independent online labour rights media platform. They have coveredworker stories and provided workers with a platform for legal consultation. At the time of their arrest, they were reporting and supporting a struggle of construction workers from Hunan, who have been working in Shenzhen to do blast hole drilling in Shenzhen in the 1990s, to claim their compensation where many of them were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis when return to their hometown.

2019年1月8日，警察闖入城中村單位，抓捕“新生代”網站編輯楊鄭君。三個月不到，3月20日，警察又再抓捕另外兩名“新生代” 編輯危志立和柯成兵。三位記者長期合力經營勞權自媒體平台“新生代”，報導工人相關的新聞和故事，並且提供勞權法律諮詢。“新生代”三位記者被抓捕時，正緊密報導和支持湖南建築工人追討賠償的鬥爭，這些建築工人於1990年代在深圳從事爆破和風鑽的工作，但回到家鄉後卻診斷出患上塵肺病。

The three “iLabour” activists began supporting pneumoconiosis workers’ struggle in early 2018 by providing them with labor law consultation and sending out updates of the struggle in Shenzhen online, where to petition for more than 10 times, to make their plight visible to the public. Harassment and suppression of the iLabour editors began as early as June 2018, when Ke was summoned by police for questioning about a piece on the pneumoconiosis struggle. In the same month, Yang was apprehended by police at the scene of the pneumoconiosis protests and taken in for questioning. The editors received other threatening calls from police as they continued to report on the case. On January 8th, one day after fifty pneumoconiosis workers who were forcibly sent back to Hunan police after another attempt to petition to the Shenzhen government, Yang Zhengjun was arrested in Guangzhou. After Yang’s arrest, Wei Zhili and KeChengbing continued to help the workers and provided them with legal advice. On March 20, Wei and Ke were also arrested in Guangzhou.

由2018年年初開始，數百位湖南塵肺病工人為了讓他們艱難的處境為大眾所知，至深圳上訪超過十次，三位“新生代”編輯亦由2018年年初開始透過報導他們維權的即時消息，以及提供勞動法的諮詢。然而自2018年年中，當局就開始打壓和騷擾“新生代”的記者們，6月，楊鄭君被警察強制傳喚並審問一篇關於塵肺病維權的報導文章是否出自於他的手筆，又在塵肺病工人抗議的現場被抓捕和接受審訊。 1月8日，五十位塵肺病工人在深圳上訪後被強行送回湖南之後一日，楊鄭君被捕。危志立和柯成兵由於繼續支持湖南的工人，也於3月20日被捕。

The local policetold Yang and Wei’s families that they were arrested for helping pneumoconiosis workers. Three of them were detained at the Shenzhen No. 2 Detention Center for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, and transferred to “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location” (hereafter RSDL ). All of their lawyers’ requestsfor meetings have been refused, and basic civil and political rights were being taken away. Their families are very concerned about their personal safety and well-beingsin such a secret detention.

警察告訴楊和危的家人，他們是因為參與塵肺病工人的維權而被刑拘。最初“新生代”三人涉嫌“尋釁滋事罪”被刑拘於深圳第二看守所，而後將強制措施轉為“指定居所監視居住”（下稱“指監“）自“新生代”三人被指監後，他們的律師從未成功與其會見，他們的家人十分擔心他們的人身安全和健康。

We would like to address that helping pneumoconiosis workers to fight their compensation shouldn’t be a crime. The local government should not arbitrarily detain the “iLabour Three” due to their promotion of worker’ rights to health, a dignified life, and freedom of peaceful assembly through online platform. The poor situation of the pneumoconiosis workers is indeed the consequence of corporate violations against the labour law, and a reflection of local government ineffective enforcement of labour rules and regulations who fail to protect the health and basic rights of the workers. Instead of suppressing the voices ofworkers and activists by violence act and arbitrary detentions, the local government should ensure basic human rightswill be in place as follow:

我們在此重申，幫助塵肺病工人追討他們的賠償是無罪的。地方政府不應該因為他們在網上自媒體平台報導勞工維權、推廣工人健康權利和和平集會的權利為由任意將其拘留。塵肺病工人悲慘的處境正正反映了企業違反勞動法、地方政府不嚴正執行勞工相關規定以保護工人健康和基本權利的問題。地方政府應該立即停止用暴力和任意拘留打壓工人和行動者，並且採取以下行動來保障基本人權：

Release Yang Zhengjun, Wei Zhili and KeChengbing immediately and unconditionally;

立即無條件釋放楊鄭君、危志立、柯成兵；

Ensure that they are free from any forms of torture or cruelty, inhumane and degrading treatment, and have regular access to their family and lawyer of theirchoice;

確保楊鄭君、危志立、柯成兵免於遭受酷刑、侮辱和非人道的待遇；能規律的會見他們的家人和其自由委託的律師；

Resume the negotiation with the pneumoconiosis workers and carry out adequate compensation plan which workers voice are included.

重啟和塵肺病工人的協商，並在充分納入工人意見的原則下執行適切的賠償方案
