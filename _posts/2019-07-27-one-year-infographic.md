In recent years, it is commonly said that mainlanders have a slave mentality and dare not resist tyranny. This is not the case. Recently, China has cracked down upon a large number of people fighting for labor rights. Since the Jasic incident of 2018, there has been a wave of questioning, arrests and disappearances affecting over a hundred activists.

In Hong Kong, formation of a trade union requires only seven members with voting rights to sign on, but in mainland China, to form a trade union workers must receive the approval of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Although the Jasic workers adhered to the legal process for forming a trade union, they were fired for their activism and later arrested for campaigning for reinstatement.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/jasic2.png" width="90%"/></div>

<strong>Unbearable Conditions, Obstruction of Trade Union Formation</strong>

The working conditions at Jasic's facilities are substandard. The company has repeatedly failed to pay workers' wages, social security and housing provident funds on time and has a long list of illegal fines. The fines deducted from workers salaries every month amount to roughly 1,000 yuan per person. In order to build its company image, Jasic forces its employees who already work more than 12 hours a day to participate in a mandatory unpaid nike called “Happy Run.”

Faced with these injustices, the Jasic workers attempted to form a trade union. On May 10 of the previous year, workers submitted a petition to the Pingshan District Human Resources Bureau and the Pingshan District Federation of Trade Unions (FTU), receiving the FTU's approval to form a union. In Hong Kong, to form a trade union, it only takes seven members with voting rights to sign on to apply, but in mainland China, the establishment of "base-level trade unions, local trade unions at all levels, or national or local industrial trade union organizations must be approved by the next higher level trade union." Yet while attempting to legally form a trade union, the Jasic workers were not only obstructed by the company, but were refused help by the higher level trade union. Eventually, the factory and the police joined forces to violently suppress the workers.

From July 16th onward, the workers who initiated the trade union formation effort (including Mi Jiuping and Liu Penghua) were beaten on factory grounds and expelled from the factory. On July 27th, after multiple previous attempts to return to work, workers staged another protest action at the Jasic factory gates. As they attempted to reenter the factory grounds, factory security called on local police to arrest the protesters. That night, supporters of the workers arrived at the Yanziling police station where the arrested workers were being held, only to themselves be arrested. Two days later, the police announced that the workers and supporters had all been criminally detained for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble."

<strong>When Workers Were Attacked, Students Took Action</strong>

After the Jasic workers were arrested, many students publicly expressed their solidarity, wrote letters of solidarity and went to the police station to support the arrested workers, playing an important role in the movement. In addition to supporting workers' rights to establish a trade unions and defend their rights, and being against the police who act as a machine of the state, students also understood the conditions of the workers and sympathized with them. This can be seen in their letters of support, for example in the "Shenzhen's 7·27 Worker Activist Arrests" letter written by the students of Renmin University:

"A few years ago, there was Foxconn workers' serial suicides, this spilling of blood reflects the depth of the current class contradiction. A few months ago, Beijing cleaned up its low-end population, and the silent workers army painted a dark irony. Recently, pneumoconiosis-afflicted workers are struggling to defend their rights, and this silent humiliation shouts out the unfairness faced by the worker masses...

The oppressive practices of Jasic have left the workers unable to bear it any longer: illegal shift adjustments, disguised salary reductions, forced attendance at unpaid company activities, strict fines, rampant exploitation, underpaid housing providence fund payments, intimidation of employees and violation of their privacy, perverted management peeking into the toilets, obstruction of workers forming a union and even beating of employees. Yet the Yanziling police not only do not defend the legitimate rights and interests of workers, they instead beat and illegally detain them! "

Students and other supporters formed the Jasic Worker Support Group. This group continued to protest at the police station and call for the release of the arrested workers for nearly a month before being arrested en masse on August 24th.

<strong>The crackdown expands beyond workers and immediate supporters</strong>

From September to November 2018, one after the other, more workers and students were arrested and disappeared, and the crackdown spread. First, student groups concerned with labor rights and Marxism were blocked from registering, later labor activists and media activists who had not participated in the Jasic events also disappeared. Even staff at social work organizations that had cooperated with the government were arrested. Specific groups include:

1 Other worker supporters

Other than Jasic workers, workers from other factories have come out to support and been arrested.

Crackdown period: July 2018 to the present

2 Student networks

Beginning in September 2018, different Marxist student socities were blocked from registering, while Peking University's Marxist society was completely reconstituted with new membership at a stroke of the school authorities' pen, eliminating all existing members from the membership rolls. Those students who had participated in Jasic solidarity efforts were serially arrested, abducted or disappeared.

Crackdown period: September 2018 to the present

3 Labor rights organizations

In August 2018, Fu Changguo of the "Da Gong Zhe" center for migrant workers, who provided legal education and training to workers, was arrested and accused of inciting the Jasic events despite his minimal participation. In January the next year, five staff or former staff of labor rights organizations were arrested. Among them are Wu Guijun, the former Diweixin worker and strike leader who formed the organzation "Xin Gong Yi" to provide legal consultation to workers faced with factory closure and to teach workers about their legal rights in order to negotiate with the factory; and the Chunfeng Labor Dispute Service Center's coordinator Zhang Zhiru, and former staff Jian Hui and Song Jiahui, who conduct legal outreach, consultation and safety trainings for workers.

Crackdown period: 10 August 2018, 20 January 2019

4 Labour-oriented independent media

Arrestees Wei Zhili, Ke Chengbing and Yang Zhengjun are editors of the "iLabour" media platform and folllowed and supported Hunan pneumoconiosis workers' campaign for occupational disease compensation. Wuqiong Wenqian, who was arrested on her way to work, was the former chief editor of Groundbreaking. Earlier on, editors of the leftist website "Red Flag" were also arrested.

Crackdown period: August 2018 to the present

5 Social Workers

In Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, social workers serving migrant worker communities have been arrested. Currently they include Li Dajun, coordinator of Beijing's Lengquan Hope Community, which serves migrant workers and their children; Li Changjiang, coordinator of the Shenzhen's Qinghu Community School, which provides community services to migrant workers; Liang Zicun, a Tsinghua Post-Doctoratal researcher engaged in study of labor questions and social work with vocational school students; and Tong Feifei, of the Guangdong Mumian Social Work Service Center, which engages in youth development, women's health and community development work and also works heavily in migrant worker communities.

Crackdown period: May 2019



<h3>Timeline of the Crackdown</h3>

In the year since the outbreak, the Chinese police have launched a wave of nationwide arrests. More than 110 people directly or indirectly connected to the Jasic incident have been arrested, and 53 of them were still in detention. From the time and object of each arrest, it can be seen that the actions of the mainland police are planned, organized and have clear objectives.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/jasic5.png" width="90%"/></div>

<strong>The first wave: suppressing the immediate activists</strong>

The first large-scale arrests related to the Jasic incident occurred between July and August 2018, shortly after the start of factory worker demonstrations and support actions. At the end of July and in early August, the workers and supporters who first launched and participated in the demonstrations were arrested on a large scale. Some of them were packed into police cars at the demonstration site. Other supporters were called to the police station and disappeared. One of the active supporters, Shen Mengyu, was abducted by an unidentified person on August 11.

<strong>The second wave: supressing the Support Group</strong>

Since then, university students and supporters from all over the country have formed a solidarity group and continued to demand the workers' release outside the police station. As of August 24, the room where Support Group members were staying was raided by police and over 50 members were arrested. Four of them remain in custody. The search and arrest during this period was clearly aimed at immediately suppressing the demonstrations.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/jasic6.png" width="90%"/></div>

<strong>The third wave: expanding crackdown</strong>

The arrests did not stop with the immediate demonstrators. Others who had supported the Jasic workers began to be "cleared up" over the next few months. September and October saw scattered arrests, while in November 2018, the Guangdong police raided the homes of and arrested 18 people who had supported the Jasic workers in Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenzhen and other places. The arrested included recent university graduates and staff from the Shenzhen Qingying Social Work Center. Some were violently arrested, or even abducted by unidentified men. Their families were only able to confirm they had been arrested upon receipt of a written notice from the police. According to eyewitnesses, one of the arrested, Zhang Shengye, was beaten and forced into a car by more than ten people dressed in black.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/jasic7.png" width="90%"/></div>

<strong>The fourth wave: expanding onto campus</strong>

After the outbreak of the Jasic incident, university student groups concerned with labour rights began to receive pressure. In September, Marxist student associations started to encounter various obstacles to registration, some's applications were directly denied, while others found themselves unable to register for lack of a teacher willing to sponsor them. At the end of 2018, arrests began to expand to campus as well. First, they took away Qiu Zhanxuan, president of the Peking University Marxist Society, followed by ten other students who had expressed their support for the Jasic demonstrations. Some students were also expelled. According to information provided by the Support Group, some student members of the Support Group were were shown confession videos of the arrested Support Group members during their questioning.

<strong>The fifth wave: those unconnected with Jasic arrested</strong>

At the same time, labor rights groups with no clear relationship to the Jasic demonstrations began to be arrested. In January, five staff or former staff of various Guangdong labor NGOs were apprehended from their homes and criminally detained on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble." Three editors of the labor rights media platform "iLabour" were also arrested from January to March. In May, five people from Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Beijing involved in social work with migrant workers were also arrested.

Thus far, none of these 13 labour activists and social workers have been released. From the arrests that began in early 2019, it is clear that the Jasic crackdown has expanded from mere crackdown on the Jasic movement to a much wider sweep of the labour movement. Social work organizations and labour rights activists at large have become targets.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The future of freedom of speech in Hong Kong is likely to continue to narrow. Recently, demostrations and marches have not retreated in the face of repression, and this is definitely worthy of support and encouragement. However, it is imperative to think about how to continue to change society in an environment of narrowing freedom of speech. By learning about the situation of Chinese workers, in addition to developing understanding and sympathy, perhaps there are lessons we can draw on.
